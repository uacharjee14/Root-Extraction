# Root-Extraction
The code for root extraction in finite abelian p groups
The following inputs have to be provided:
1. The group Description (the structure of the group)
2. The program works with standard basis (but can be changes easily to work with the basis of your choice)
3. The group element(Actually the program expects the input in terms of the discrete log of the element with respect to the basis but this can be computes with any other existent algorithm)

The program outputs another basis that is the solution to the root extraction problem.
